        <strong>Cyclistic Bike Data</strong> / <a href="https://github.com/RConnaught/Short_Portfolio/blob/master/How_Does_a_Bike_Share_Navigate_Speedy_Success_02.ipynb">Github</a><br />
        JULY 2022 - AUGUST 2022<br />
    <br />
        Through Google Collaboratory, I created a Python notebook that cleaned, 
        transformed data into a visualized comparison. In a hypothetical scenario, 
        A bike sharing company wants to maximize the number of their annual membership. 
        In this scenario, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members 
        use Cyclistic bikes differently.
